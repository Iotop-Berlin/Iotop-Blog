# Iotop-Blog

This repository is a university project. In this project I tried to apply web development basics in multiple areas needed to get a dynamic web app connected to a database.
For developing it I heavily oriented myself on videos from [Pretty Printed](https://github.com/PrettyPrinted/youtube_video_code) and [Ahnaf Zamil](https://github.com/ahnaf-zamil/flask-blog-tutorial)
For Deployment I used Heroku. Over the whole process I also got a lot of help from [Maurice](https://github.com/mrcgrhrdt).

# Every Time You Develop on Your Project

- Go to your terminal and activate your virtual environment for this project:

  macOS/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`

# Installation Instructions

This will be a quick overview of steps for how to use this template on your own project, but will not be a line-for-line cookbook. Happy codingðŸš€

## Before you start...

You should have:

Python 3.8.x or newer, installed on your computer
Visual Studio Code (or another IDE of your choosing) installed on your computer
A GitHub account

## Make This Your Own

Ready to go? Start by making this project your own:

Fork this repository into your GitHub account. This is a good time to rename the repository to have the name of your project - but you can do that later, too.
Choose (or create) a working directory on your own computer and change directory into it
Clone your version onto your computer in that working directory. You don't know how to do that? Look [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository).
Now you should be ready to get the starter template running on your computer!
